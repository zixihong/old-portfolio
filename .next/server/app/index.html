The project developed a groundbreaking diagnostic system that uses gold nanoparticles to detect and quantify Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). By pumping RSV-aggregated and unaggregated nanoparticles through a microcapillary intersected by lasers, the system generates and detects nanobubbles, allowing for both rapid diagnosis and precise viral quantification. The system achieved a 99.99% diagnostic accuracy in just 5.2 minutes, outperforming current methods like PCR and rapid antigen tests. Additionally, the virion counting mechanism, validated by Poisson statistics, reached a 98.52% accuracy rate, providing crucial data to healthcare professionals for treatment decisions.</div><div class="ProjectsGrid_imageContainer__4A0O_"><img src="/desc/countingprincipal.png" alt="Digitial Counting Principal" width="400" height="400"/><img src="/desc/digitalphotoacoustic.png" alt="Photoacoustic Data Analaysis" width="600" height="500"/></div><div class="ProjectsGrid_featuresList__StQVx"><div class="ProjectsGrid_feature__GY7MD"><b>Laser Detection System:</b> Using Python, I developed the laser detection system that captured data from the 532 nm and 633 nm lasers.

Ultimately, The model we developed analyzes an infant&#x27;s health and biological parameters to predict infection severity and other useful infromation that could be tracked. I trained the model on over 1 million samples generated from various combinations of weight, age, and virion count, computing a severity index as the output. To ensure robustness, I introduced a dataset with added variance to simulate real-world noise. A unique aspect of my approach was incorporating domain-specific biological knowledge, where weight was treated as the dominant health indicator. Using Bayesian Ridge Regression, I captured the non-linear relationships among these factors. The final model achieved an average R² score of 0.72 and a mean-squared error (MSE) of 0.122, demonstrating strong predictive capabilities after validating on 20% of the dataset.</div><div class="ProjectsGrid_imageContainer__4A0O_"><img src="/desc/bayesianss1.png" alt="Bayesian Ridge Regression instructions" width="600" height="500"/><img src="/desc/bayesianss2.png" alt="Bayesian Ridge Regression Instructions 2" width="500" height="500"/></div><div class="ProjectsGrid_featuresList__StQVx"><div class="ProjectsGrid_feature__GY7MD"><b>Programming Languages:</b> I implemented the model using Python, with Pandas for data handling and NumPy for efficient numerical computations.</div><div class="ProjectsGrid_feature__GY7MD"><b>Model Implementation:</b> The Bayesian Ridge Regression model was developed using Scikit-learn, allowing for hyperparameter tuning of key parameters (α and λ) to ensure optimal model fitting for the complex relationships between the input variables.</div><div class="ProjectsGrid_feature__GY7MD"><b>Severity Index Calculation:</b> Using domain-specific biological insights, the severity index formula emphasized weight deviations and age-related immunity differences.
